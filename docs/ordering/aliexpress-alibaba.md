## Buying from AliExpress/Alibaba

When purchasing from AliExpress, keep in mind that customer service, refunds, and returns may not be as robust as with larger, more established retailers like Amazon. Your payment information is encrypted through AliPay, making purchases safe, but be aware of potential limitations on refunds and returns. *Buy at your own risk.*

Ensure you're satisfied with your purchase by thoroughly researching a seller before buying, taking note of their policies and reputation.

We recommend the following steps:

1. **Payment Method**: Choose a credit card or debit card that offers chargeback protection. If the seller is unable or unwilling to issue a refund, you can dispute the transaction and potentially get your money back through the chargeback process.

2. **Taxes**: We recommend only trusted sellers who take care of VAT/Taxes beforehand for buyers in Europe, which means you won't have to pay VAT when the package arrives in the EU.

::: warning
This information applies when ordering from sellers other than HiCity or Jenny Airreps website. If you order from those websites, you don't need to worry about customs declarations or the type of box, as they will be handled automatically.
:::

3. **Product Box**: For a box with Apple logos, request a "with Apple box" instead of a "no logo box". However, this carries a higher risk of the package being seized at customs and you not receiving a refund. We don't recommend this option, as the AirPods inside are the same regardless of the box. If you want to take the risk, you can request a box with Apple logos.

4. **Order Confirmation**: After you purchase, go to your order page and check the name of your product (e.g. Pro Airoha white). Click "Contact Supplier" to message the seller and confirm that they are sending the correct product. Don't ask about specific features or details like "is this v2.5 with an Airoha chip?", as the sellers may not use these names.

::: tip
Let the sellers know that you are from the AirReps community. This will ensure they provide you with excellent service and uphold our community's standards. Plus, it gives us leverage to advocate for future buyers like you.

5. **Shipping Timer**: On your Order page on AliExpress, there will be a shipping countdown timer that will automatically confirm delivery after a certain number of days. If the timer is about to expire and you haven't received your order, make sure to click "Extend Shipping Time" to give yourself an additional 15 days. Only click "Order Received" once you have received your order and confirmed that it is in good working condition.

##FAQ

::: details Why can I only pay with Wise or Bitcoin!?
At present, the majority of our sellers accept payments via Wise - a reputable international money transfer service, or through various forms of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. This preference has emerged due to past issues with PayPal, which was previously closed following complaints related to Apple's trademarks.
However, it's worth noting that there may be changes on the horizon. HiCity, one of our prominent sellers, is considering the inclusion of credit card payments in the near future.
In the meantime, if you're looking for alternatives that already accept credit card payments, consider using either Jenny's Alibaba or BESChan's Weidian link with an agent, both platforms allows you to pay with a credit card respectively.

::: details Why are there so few AliExpress/Alibaba links?
There used to be a lot more links to AliExpress and Alibaba stores, but Apple started aggressively cracking down on these, making it nearly impossible to maintain the links. As a result, the sellers opened their own websites, which are more secure and robust. However a few Alibaba links do remain, if this is important to, you you can order there.
