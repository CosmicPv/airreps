::: tip
Some websites or Alibaba links providing credit card payments may have discrete website branding, look after the version number you want. You can safely ignore the images of generic products. This is done in order to comply with the copyright policies some credit card payment gateways may have.

::: tip
Choosing a Weidian link requires the use of an agent for shipping. We recommend this option only if you wish to consolidate shipping with other items and are familiar with platforms like [SugarGoo](https://airreps.link/sugargoo) or [PandaBuy](https://airreps.link/pandabuy).
