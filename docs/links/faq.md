# FAQ (Links)

::: details Will I get a good quality unit?
It is not possible to guarantee the quality of a unit, as it can vary even among units from the same seller. However, the sellers mentioned in the original text are generally known for offering good quality products.
:::

::: details How do I contact sellers?
To contact sellers, you can join the AirReps Discord: https://airreps.link/discord and obtain their WhatsApp numbers, as they are not publicly available. Alternatively, you can use AliExpress to message them by clicking "Contact Supplier".
:::

::: details Is the minimum order more than one unit?
If you would like to order only one unit, you can click "Buy Sample" on the product page. Alternatively, you can contact the seller and request that they create an order for a single unit for you.
:::

::: details I ordered x days ago and my package hasn't arrived yet. What should I do?
Shipping from China can sometimes take a while. Tracking information may disappear once the package leaves China, and will only be updated once it reaches customs in your country. If it has been a long time and there is still no tracking information available, you should contact your seller for an update.
:::

::: details My tracking information is in Chinese. What should I do?
If you have tracking information that is in Chinese, you can copy the tracking number and paste it into the website 17Track: https://www.17track.net/. This will allow you to see updates in English. Alternatively, you can open the tracking updates on a computer and paste them into Google Translate to see them in a different language.
:::

::: details My card is not working. What should I do?
If your card is not working, you should contact the seller and ask if they will accept a different form of payment. Keep in mind that some alternative payment methods, such as Transferwise and Xoom, do not offer buyer protection. If the seller is unable to accept a different form of payment, you can try using a different card or purchasing from a different seller. You may also be able to verify your card through Apple Pay (if you have access to an iOS device) and use Apple Pay to make the purchase.
:::

::: details The shipping cost is too high. What should I do?
If the shipping cost is too high, you can contact the seller and ask if they can offer a cheaper shipping option, such as ePacket. You can also ask if they can ship the package through an agent, which may be less expensive. If the seller is unable to offer a cheaper shipping option, you may want to consider purchasing from a different seller.
